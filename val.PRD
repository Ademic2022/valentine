## 🚀 Advanced Valentine Interactive Web App (React Version)

I want to build a **fun, interactive, and visually appealing Valentine’s web app using React**.

### 💖 Core Concept

When the page loads, it should display a romantic message:

> **“Deal!!! Will you be my Valentine? ❤️”**

The entire layout should be centered both vertically and horizontally.

---

## 🎯 Functional Requirements

### 1️⃣ Buttons

Initially, show two buttons:

* **Yes 💖**
* **Try other option 🤔**

---

### 2️⃣ Try Other Option Behavior

When the user clicks **“Try other option”**:

* A new button appears:
  **“No 😅”**

* The “No” button should be impossible to click:

  * When the user hovers over it, it should smoothly move to a random position.
  * The movement should be animated (not instant teleporting).
  * It must always stay fully inside the visible viewport.
  * On mobile, it should move when tapped or when the finger gets close (touch start).

---

### 3️⃣ Yes Button Behavior

When the user clicks **“Yes 💖”**:

* Trigger:

  * 🎉 Confetti explosion animation
  * 💘 Floating heart animations
  * ✨ Smooth scaling animation of the success message

* Replace the original message with:

> **“Yay!!! I knew you would say yes! 💘✨”**

* Add a soft bounce or glow effect to the message.
* Optional: Add romantic background music (can be muted by default).

---

## 🎨 Design Requirements

* Theme: Cute, romantic, pink/red gradient background
* Use soft shadows and rounded buttons
* Add hover animations for buttons (scale + glow)
* Smooth transitions everywhere
* Floating animated hearts in the background
* Subtle particle or sparkle effects
* Fully responsive (mobile + desktop)
* Modern UI design

---

## ⚛️ Technical Requirements

* Use **React (functional components + hooks)**
* Use modern styling:

  * TailwindCSS or CSS modules (preferred: Tailwind)
* Use a confetti library like:

  * `canvas-confetti` or `react-confetti`
* Use clean component structure
* Use state management for:

  * Showing the "No" button
  * Triggering animations
  * Confetti effect
* Make animations smooth using:

  * CSS transitions OR Framer Motion (preferred for advanced animation)

---

## ✨ Extra Polish (Advanced Touch)

* Add smooth entrance animation when the page loads.
* Add a playful shake animation when trying to catch the “No” button.
* Add a growing effect to the “Yes” button every time the “No” button escapes.
* Add subtle sound effects (optional).
* Make it feel like a mini romantic interactive game.

---

The final result should feel:

* Fun
* Playful
* Romantic
* Polished
* Modern
* High-quality
